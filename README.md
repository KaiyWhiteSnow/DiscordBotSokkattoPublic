# Discord Bot Sokkatto
## Why?
- Sokkatto was created as an attempt to get better at coding and has evolved into my personal bot. I keep updating him from time to time based on what I may need from him.

## Can I use Sokkatto?
- Yes, it is under GPLv3 license so the bot is free to use. 
## Can I help you with the bot?
- Currently not looking for testers nor co-devs.
